your guess. The clue will be "black" and "white". if the computer says "black", that means one of the

SAMPLE RUN

 THIS IS THE GAME OF MIND BLOGGER.
 I AM GOING TO PICK A NUMBER BETWEEN 0000 - 5555.
 YOU ARE TO TRY TO GET THAT NUMBER IN THE MINIMAL AMOUNT OF GUESSES.
 
EVERYTIME YOU GUESS A NUMBER I WILL GIVE YOU CLUES AS TO
HOW CLOSE YOU ARE TO THE NUMBER I GIVE. THIS CLUES WILL BE 'BLACK' AND 'WHITE'. 
IF I SAY 'BLACK', THEN THAT MEANS THAT ONE OF THE DIGITS IS CORRECT
BUT NOT IN THE RIGHT ORDER. IF I SAY 'WHITE', THEN YOU HAVE A CORRECT DIGIT IN THE CORRECT ORDER. 
IT IS UP TO YOU TO LOGICALLY FIGURE WHAT NUMBERS ARE CORRECT.
 
 FOR EXAMPLE: THE NUMBER IS 2510
 YOUR GUESS: 2413
 YOU WOULD GET A 'BLACK' BECAUSE THE NUMBER 2 IS CORRECT BUT IN THE WHRONG ORDER AND A
'WHITE' BECAUSE
 YOU GUESSED THE NUMBER 1 WHICH WAS THE CORRECT NUMBER IN THE CORRECT ORDER.
 MORE THAN 1 PEOPLE CAN PLAY. TRY TO SEE WHO CAN DO THE BEST.
 
This Game is created using c language only.
